# Mitigation Techniques

1. As a **disgruntled registered user**, I want to **flood the web server with login attempts** so I can **overload the web server so it goes down**.

* Mitigation: In code, only allow an ip to only have so many login attempts at one given time. Temporarily disable their privileges to login after so many attempts
* Mitigation: In code, add Google's protection dependency against this

2. As a **disgruntled registered user**, I want to **enter data in between script tags** so I can **break the website's functionality**.
